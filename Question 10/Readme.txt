Array Right Shifting in C
Problem Statement: Right Shift Subarray
Description:
You are given an array of integers a, its size n, and two integers r (right bound) and l (left bound) that define a subarray. Your task is to perform a right shift operation on the subarray a[r..l] by a given number of times d. Return the modified array.
Example:

Input:
Array a: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Size n: 5
Right Bound r: 1
Left Bound l: 3
Number of times to shift right d: 2

Output:
Modified Array: [1, 4, 5, 2, 3]

Code Explanation
The program starts by taking user input for the size of the array (n) and its elements.

It then asks the user to specify the right (r) and left (l) bounds of the subarray to be shifted, as well as the number of times to shift it to the right (d).

The program performs the right shift operation by repeatedly moving each element of the subarray one position to the right, d times.

After the right shift operation is completed, the program prints the modified array.
