Problem Statement: Saving for Your Dream Car

Description:
You have set your eyes on your dream car, which costs 4,000,000 units of currency. However, you can't wait to own it and want to make a down payment of 500,000 units as soon as possible.
Your current monthly salary is 25,000 units. You receive a yearly hike of 7% in your salary, which is compounded monthly. You decide to save a fixed percentage of your monthly salary each month towards the down payment. Additionally, you can specify a monthly savings amount.
Write a C program to calculate how many months you need to work and save in order to reach the down payment amount of 500,000 units and make your dream car yours!

Input:
Monthly Salary (25,000 units)
Monthly Savings Amount (a fixed percentage of your monthly salary)
Dream Car Cost (4,000,000 units)
Down Payment (500,000 units)
Yearly Hike Percentage (7%)

Output:
Number of Months Required to Reach Down Payment

Code Explanation:
In this C code, we start with your current monthly salary and iterate through months, saving a fixed percentage of your salary each month. We apply the yearly hike to your monthly salary, compounded monthly. The loop continues until your savings reach or exceed the down payment amount. Finally, the program prints the number of months required to reach the down payment.
