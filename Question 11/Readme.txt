String Reversal in C++
This C++ program demonstrates how to reverse a string containing numbers separated by spaces.

Code Explanation
The program defines a function reverse that takes a string (number) as input and reverses it.

Inside the reverse function, it iterates through the characters of the string in reverse order and prints them, effectively reversing the string.

In the main function, a sample string num containing numbers separated by spaces is provided as input to the reverse function.

The program then prints both the original and reversed strings.
