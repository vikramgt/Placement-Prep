Problem Statement: Reverse String with Delimited Numbers

Description:

You are given a string num containing numbers separated by spaces. Your task is to reverse the string while keeping the numbers and spaces in their original positions. Return the reversed string.

Example:
Input: "1 2 3 4"
Output: "4 3 2 1"

Code Explanation
The program defines a function reverse that takes a string (number) as input and reverses it.

Inside the reverse function, it iterates through the characters of the string in reverse order and prints them, effectively reversing the string.

In the main function, a sample string num containing numbers separated by spaces is provided as input to the reverse function.

The program then prints both the original and reversed strings.
