Description:

You are given a string str and an integer r. Your task is to apply Caesar Cipher encryption to the string by rotating each alphabetical character by r positions to the right in the alphabet. Non-alphabetical characters should remain unchanged. Print the encrypted string.

Example:

Input:

str = "Hello, World!"
r = 3
Output:

"After Rotation: Khoor, Zruog!"
Code Explanation:

The program first prompts the user to enter a string (str) and an integer (rotation) representing the number of positions to rotate each alphabetical character.

It calls the cesar function, passing the str and rotation as arguments.

The cesar function is defined to perform Caesar Cipher encryption on the input string. It initializes an integer i for iteration.

It iterates through the characters of the string using a for loop. For each character, it checks if it is an alphabetical character using the isalpha function.

If the character is alphabetical, it applies the Caesar Cipher rotation by adding r to the ASCII value of the character. This effectively rotates the character to the right in the alphabet.

The program continues iterating through the string, applying the rotation only to alphabetical characters while leaving non-alphabetical characters unchanged.

After processing the entire string, the program prints the encrypted string with the message "After Rotation."

This code allows you to encrypt a given string using the Caesar Cipher by rotating each alphabetical character by a specified number of positions to the right.
