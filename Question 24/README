Problem Statement: Arithmetic Progression Sum Calculation

Description:
You are given the first term (a), common difference (d), and the value of n (number of terms) in an arithmetic progression. Your task is to calculate and print the sum of the first n terms of the arithmetic progression.

Example:
Input:
First term a = 2
Common difference d = 3
Number of terms n = 5

Output:
"The sum of the first 5 terms of the arithmetic progression is: 35"

Code Explanation:
The program first prints a message to indicate that it will calculate the sum of an arithmetic progression.
It then prompts the user to enter three integer values: a (the first term), d (the common difference), and n (the number of terms) using scanf.
The program calculates the sum of the first n terms of the arithmetic progression using the formula:

sum = (n/2) * [2a + (n-1)d]

This formula calculates the sum of an arithmetic progression efficiently.
Finally, the program prints the calculated sum along with a message indicating the result.
This code allows you to calculate and print the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic progression based on the provided values of a, d, and n.
