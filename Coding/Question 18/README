Problem Statement: Find the Closest Number Divisible by Another Number

Description:
You are given two positive integers, n and m. Your task is to find and print the closest number to n that is divisible by m.

Example:
Input:
n = 17
m = 5
Output:

"The closest number to 17 divisible by 5 is: 15"

Code Explanation:

The program first prompts the user to enter two positive integers, n and m, for which the closest number divisible by m needs to be calculated.
It calls the closest function, passing n and m as arguments.
The closest function is defined to find the closest number to n that is divisible by m. It initializes a variable maxi to store the result.
The function uses a for loop that starts from n and iterates backward until it finds the first number that is divisible by m (i.e., i % m == 0). When such a number is found, it assigns it to maxi and breaks out of the loop.
The closest function returns maxi as the result.
Finally, the main function prints the closest number found.
This code allows you to find and print the closest number to n that is divisible by m.
