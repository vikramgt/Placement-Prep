Problem Statement: Find the Closest Number Divisible by Another Number Using ABS

Description:
You are given two integers, n and m. Your task is to find and print the closest number to n that is divisible by m.

Example:
Input:

n = 17
m = 5

Output:
"The closest number to 17 divisible by 5 is: 15"
Code Explanation:

The program first prompts the user to enter two integers, n and m, for which the closest number divisible by m needs to be calculated.
It calls the closest function, passing n and m as arguments.
The closest function is defined to find the closest number to n that is divisible by m. It calculates q as the quotient of n divided by m. It then calculates two potential candidates for the closest number:
p1 = q * m
p2 = (n * m) > 0 ? (m * (q + 1)) : (m * (q - 1))
The abs function is used to calculate the absolute difference between n and each candidate, i.e., abs(n - p1) and abs(n - p2).
The function compares the absolute differences and returns the candidate with the smaller absolute difference as the result.
Finally, the main function prints the closest number found.
This code allows you to find and print the closest number to n that is divisible by m based on the absolute difference between the potential candidates.
