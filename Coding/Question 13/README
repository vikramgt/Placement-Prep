Problem Statement: Count Consonants in a String

Description:
You are given a string str containing a sequence of lowercase letters and a string consonent containing a list of consonant letters. Your task is to count the number of consonant characters in the input string str. Return the count of consonants.

Example:
Input:
str = "hello world"
consonent = "bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz"
Output: 7

Code Explanation
The program defines a string str containing the input string "hello world."

It also defines a string consonent containing all the consonant characters.

The program uses nested loops to compare each character in the input string with the characters in the consonent string.

If a match is found, it increments the count variable.

Finally, it prints the count of consonants in the string.
