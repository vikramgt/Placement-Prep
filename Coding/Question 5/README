Problem Statement: Calculate Sum of Even and Odd Numbers in an Array

Description:
You are given an array a containing n integer elements. Your task is to calculate and print the sum of even and odd numbers separately within the array.

Example:
Input:
n = 5
Array Elements: [2, 4, 7, 1, 6]

Output:
"The sum of even numbers is: 12"
"The sum of odd numbers is: 8"

Code Explanation:

The program first initializes integer variables i, j, n, even, and odd. n represents the size of the array, i and j are used for iteration, and even and odd will store the sums of even and odd numbers, respectively.

The program prints a message to prompt the user to enter the size of the array (n) and then the array elements using a for loop with scanf.

After reading the array elements, the program enters another for loop to iterate through the array and calculate the sum of even and odd numbers.

Within the loop, it checks if the current element a[i] is even or odd using the condition if (a[i] % 2 == 0). If it's even, it adds it to the even variable; otherwise, it adds it to the odd variable.

After completing the iteration, the program prints the calculated sums of even and odd numbers separately using printf.

This code effectively calculates and prints the sum of even and odd numbers within an array based on the provided array size and elements.
