Problem Statement: Transpose of a Matrix

Description:
You are given a matrix a of size r rows and c columns. Your task is to calculate and print the transpose of the given matrix.

Example:
Input:
Rows r = 3
Columns c = 2
Matrix a:
1 2
3 4
5 6

Output:
Transpose of the matrix:
1 3 5
2 4 6

Code Explanation:

The program first prompts the user to enter the number of rows (r) and columns (c) of the matrix.
It then initializes a 2D integer array a of size r x c to store the matrix elements.
Using nested for loops, the program reads the elements of the matrix from the user and stores them in the a array.
After reading the elements, the program proceeds to calculate and print the transpose of the matrix. It does this using nested for loops as well.
In the transpose, the rows of the original matrix become columns, and the columns become rows. So, it iterates through the original matrix and prints the elements of the transpose by switching the row and column indices.
The program prints the transpose of the matrix.
This code allows you to calculate and print the transpose of a given matrix.
