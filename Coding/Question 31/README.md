Problem Statement: Check if Array is in Decreasing Order

Description: You are given an array of integers. Your task is to determine whether the elements in the array are in decreasing order or not. Write a C program that checks if the given array is in decreasing order or not.

Input: Size of the array (a positive integer) Array elements (integers separated by spaces)

Output: "Yes" if the array is in decreasing order. "No" if the array is not in decreasing order.

Code Explanation:

In this C code, you input the size of the array and the array elements. The program checks if the array is in decreasing order by comparing each element with the previous one. If it finds any element that is greater than or equal to the previous one, it sets isDecreasing to 0, indicating that the array is not in decreasing order. Finally, it outputs "Yes" if the array is in decreasing order and "No" if it is not.
