Problem Statement: Perform Circular Shifts on an Array

Description:
You are given an array a containing integer elements and a choice ch to perform circular shifts on the array. You can choose to shift the elements to the left or right by a specified number of positions. Your task is to implement a function shift(ch, a) that performs the circular shift as per the choice and returns the modified array.

If ch is 1, perform a left circular shift on the array a.
If ch is 2, perform a right circular shift on the array a.

Example:
Input:
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
ch = 1 (left circular shift)

Output:
[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]
(Explanation: The array is shifted to the left by 1 position.)

Code Explanation:

The program defines a function shift(ch, a) that takes two arguments: ch for the choice of shift (left or right) and a for the input array.

Inside the function, it first checks the value of ch. If ch is 1, it performs a left circular shift; if ch is 2, it performs a right circular shift.

For a left circular shift (if ch is 1), it asks the user for the number of times to shift to the left (d). It then uses a for loop to shift the elements to the left by repeatedly removing the first element and appending it to the end of the array (a).

For a right circular shift (if ch is 2), it asks the user for the number of times to shift to the right (d). It uses a for loop to shift the elements to the right by repeatedly removing the last element and inserting it at the beginning of the array (a).

The modified array a is returned by the function.

The main part of the code initializes an array a and prompts the user to choose either a left (1) or right (2) circular shift. It then calls the shift function to perform the circular shift and prints the modified array.

This code effectively performs circular shifts on an array based on the user's choice and returns the modified array.
