Bit Manipulation in C
This C program demonstrates bit manipulation using the OR operator to set a specific bit in an integer variable.

Code Explanation
The program defines two integer variables: n and pos, where n represents the number you want to manipulate, and pos represents the position of the bit you want to set.

It uses the | (OR) operator along with the bitwise left shift operator << to set the bit at the specified position in n.

Finally, it prints the modified value of n to the console.
