Bit Manipulation in C:

Problem Description: You are given two integers, n and pos. Your task is to set the bit at the pos-th position (0-based index) in the binary representation of n to 1. Return the modified integer.

Example:
Input:
n = 5 (binary representation: 0101)
pos = 2
Output:
Modified n = 7 (binary representation: 0111)

Code Explanation
The program defines two integer variables: n and pos, where n represents the number you want to manipulate, and pos represents the position of the bit you want to set.

It uses the | (OR) operator along with the bitwise left shift operator << to set the bit at the specified position in n.

Finally, it prints the modified value of n to the console.
