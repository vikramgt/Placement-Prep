Problem Statement: Convert Decimal to Binary

Description:
You are given a decimal number n. Your task is to convert it to its binary representation and print the binary digits.

Example:
Input:
n = 8

Output:
"The binary representation of 8 is: 1000"

Code Explanation:

The program initializes three variables: l, n, and i. l will be used to keep track of the length of the binary representation, n is the decimal number to be converted, and i is an iterator.
It declares an integer array arr of size n to store the binary digits.
The program enters a while loop that continues until n becomes zero.
Inside the loop, it calculates the binary digit of n at the current position (from right to left) by taking the remainder of n divided by 2 (n % 2). This remainder is either 0 or 1, representing the binary digit.
The binary digit is stored in the arr array at the index l.
The n variable is divided by 2 (n /= 2) to move on to the next bit.
The l variable is incremented to keep track of the length of the binary representation.
After the while loop, the program enters a for loop that iterates from l-1 down to 0. This loop prints the binary digits in reverse order (from left to right).
Finally, the program prints the binary representation of the decimal number.
This code allows you to convert a decimal number to its binary representation and print the binary digits.
