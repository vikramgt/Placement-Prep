Problem Statement: Convert String to Lowercase

Description:
You are given an input string s containing a sequence of characters. Your task is to convert all uppercase letters in the string to lowercase. Return the modified string.

Example:
Input: "Hello, World!"
Output: "hello, world!"

Code Explanation:

The program first declares a character array s with a size of 150 characters to store the input string.

It initializes an integer i for iteration.

The program prints a message to prompt the user to enter a string using scanf. The %[^\n] format specifier is used to read the entire line until the newline character.

It enters a for loop to iterate through each character in the string s.

Inside the loop, the program checks if the current character is an uppercase letter by comparing it with the ASCII values of 'A' and 'Z' using the condition if (s[i] >= 'A' && s[i] <= 'Z').

If the character is uppercase, it converts it to lowercase by adding 32 to its ASCII value. This conversion works because the ASCII values of uppercase and lowercase letters have a difference of 32.

After the loop finishes processing the entire string, the program prints the modified string, which is now in lowercase.

This code allows you to convert all uppercase letters in an input string to lowercase and then prints the modified lowercase string.
