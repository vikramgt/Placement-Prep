Problem Statement: Find the Smallest Number in an Array

Description:
You are given an array a containing m integer elements. Your task is to find and print the smallest number among these elements.

Example:
Input:
m = 5
Array Elements: [7, 2, 10, 4, 1]

Output:
"The entered elements are: 7 2 10 4 1"
"The smallest number is: 1"

Code Explanation:

The program first initializes integer variables m, i, and min. m represents the number of elements in the array, i is used for iteration, and min will store the smallest number found in the array.

The program prints a message to prompt the user to enter the number of elements in the array (m) using scanf.

It then enters a for loop to read the elements of the array a using scanf. The loop iterates m times to read all the elements.

After reading the array elements, the program enters another for loop to print the entered elements in the array in a space-separated format.

Next, the program initializes the min variable with the first element of the array, min = a[0].

It enters another for loop to iterate through the array and find the smallest number. Within this loop, it checks if the current element a[i] is smaller than the current minimum min. If it is, it updates the min variable with the new smallest value.

Finally, the program prints the smallest number found as "The smallest number is: [min]" using printf.

This code effectively finds and prints the smallest number among the elements in an array based on the provided array size and elements.
