Problem Statement: Check if a Specific Bit is Set in a Number

Description:
You are given an integer n and a position pos. Your task is to check if the bit at the specified position pos is set (i.e., it's equal to 1) or not (i.e., it's equal to 0). Print 1 if the bit is set, and 0 if it's not set.

Example:
Input:
n = 5 (binary representation: 0101)
pos = 1

Output:
"1" (because the bit at position 1 is set)

Code Explanation:

The program first declares two integer variables, n and pos, to represent the number and the position of the bit to be checked.
It uses a conditional statement (if) to check if the bit at position pos in the binary representation of n is set or not. This check is performed using the bitwise AND (&) operation along with a bit mask created by left-shifting 1 by pos positions (1 << pos).
If the result of the bitwise AND operation is not equal to 0, it means that the bit at position pos is set, and the program prints "1."
If the result is equal to 0, it means that the bit at position pos is not set, and the program prints "0."
This code allows you to check if a specific bit at a given position is set or not in a given integer n and print the result.
