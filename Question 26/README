Problem Statement: Matrix Addition

Description:
You are given two matrices, matrix A and matrix B, both having the same number of rows (r1) and columns (c1). Your task is to calculate and print the result of adding these two matrices.

Example:
Input:
Number of rows and columns: r1 = 3, c1 = 3
Matrix A:
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

Matrix B:
9 8 7
6 5 4
3 2 1

Output:
The addition of the matrix 1 and 2 is:
The resultant matrix is: 10 10 10
                        10 10 10
                        10 10 10

Code Explanation:

The program first prompts the user to enter the number of rows and columns of the matrices (r1 and c1) using scanf.

It then enters two nested loops to read the elements of both matrices, matrix A (a) and matrix B (b), using two separate sets of loops. These loops iterate through each row and column of the matrices.

Inside the loops for reading matrix A and matrix B, the program uses scanf to read the values of the elements into arrays a and b.

After reading both matrices, the program enters another set of nested loops to calculate the sum of the corresponding elements of matrices A and B and store them in the sum matrix.

Finally, the program prints the result of the addition as the resultant matrix by iterating through the sum matrix and displaying its elements row by row.

This code effectively performs matrix addition and prints the result by iterating through the matrices A and B, adding corresponding elements, and storing the result in the sum matrix. It then prints the sum matrix as the resultant matrix.
