Count Consonants in a String in C
This C program counts the number of consonants in a given string.

Code Explanation
The program defines a string str containing the input string "hello world."

It also defines a string consonent containing all the consonant characters.

The program uses nested loops to compare each character in the input string with the characters in the consonent string.

If a match is found, it increments the count variable.

Finally, it prints the count of consonants in the string.
